            prompt used: "Parsing a text."
            
## description
GAI: Students can use an AI tool like ChatPDF to parse a text, such as an article or an interview transcript, in order to identify and extract key passages. The AI tool can be programmed to analyze the text and highlight passages that are particularly insightful, relevant, or representative of the main themes or arguments.

For instance, a student might upload a reading into the AI tool and ask it to "Find three quotable passages in this text." The AI can then scan the text, identify three passages that stand out based on their content, context, or rhetorical power, and provide these passages to the student, along with their location in the text.

In addition to identifying key passages, the AI tool can also provide a summary or analysis of the text. It can highlight the main points, arguments, or themes, helping students understand the overall structure and content of the text. This can be particularly useful for dense or complex readings, where students might struggle to identify the key points on their own.

Furthermore, the AI tool can adapt to the specific needs and goals of the course. For instance, if the course emphasizes critical thinking, the AI can be programmed to identify passages that are particularly controversial, ambiguous, or open to interpretation.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for parsing text and identifying key passages, it should not replace active engagement with the text. Students should still be encouraged to read the text closely, think critically, and formulate their own interpretations. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other learning activities and strategies.

## activity
1. Log into chatGPT using the Harvard AI Sandbox
2. From search bar at the bottom of the page, specify whichever AI tool you'd like to use.
    * for this activity, we recommend using chatGPT since it tends to be better suited than the other AI tools in the sandbox for creative tasks.
