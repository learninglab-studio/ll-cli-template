## description

GAI: Students can leverage an AI tool like ChatPDF to generate discussion questions about a text, such as a journal article or a book chapter. By simply uploading the text into the AI tool, it can analyze the content and generate a series of thoughtful questions designed to guide the reading or discussion of the piece.

The AI tool can be programmed to focus on key themes, arguments, or concepts in the text, ensuring that the generated questions are relevant and insightful. For example, if the text is a scientific article, the AI might generate questions about the research methodology, the interpretation of the results, or the implications of the findings.

In addition to generating questions, the AI tool can also provide a summary of the text, highlighting the main points and arguments. This can help students better understand the text and prepare for the discussion.

Furthermore, the AI tool can adapt to the specific needs and goals of the course. For instance, if the course emphasizes critical thinking, the AI can generate questions that prompt students to evaluate the arguments in the text, identify any biases, or consider alternative interpretations.

However, while the AI tool can be a valuable resource for guiding reading and discussion, it should not replace active engagement with the text. Students should still be encouraged to read the text closely, think critically, and formulate their own questions and insights. Therefore, the use of the AI tool should be balanced with other learning activities and strategies.
